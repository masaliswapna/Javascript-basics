"IIFE" stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
It's a common pattern used in JavaScript to create a function expression and immediately execute it.

Here's the general syntax of an IIFE:
(function() {
    // IIFE body
})();

The function is wrapped inside parentheses (function() { ... }).
The parentheses surrounding the function expression turn it into an expression rather than a declaration, allowing 
it to be immediately invoked.
The () at the end immediately invokes the function.
IIFEs are often used to create a new scope to encapsulate variables and prevent them from polluting the global scope. 
They are commonly used in scenarios like:

Creating private variables and functions.
Implementing modules.
Preventing naming conflicts.

Here's a simple example of an IIFE:
(function() {
    var message = 'Hello, world!';
    console.log(message);
})();
